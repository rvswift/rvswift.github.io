Sugata Mitra (Mitra, 2013) starts his TED talk like a visionary, “What is going to be the future of learning?” But before he can answer this he wants us to know where education has been and how that past influences our present. Where did schools as we know them today come from? According to Mitra, they originated with the last and largest empire on Earth – the British Empire.

Imagine, Mitra asks us, what it was like to run a globe-spanning empire without computers, without the Internet, without telephones. Imagine that you had to organize resources across thousands of miles, spanning oceans and continents, with only hand-written notes transported by ship. In response to this enormous challenge, the British established what we know today as the bureaucratic administrative machine. Who runs this machine and what skill sets should its members posses? British citizens filled its ranks, and those that did were required to have three skills. First, they had to have good handwriting – in the days before word processing and spell check, bad handwriting could do irreparable harm to an empire. Second, to decipher and act on written communication, they had to be able to read. And third, they had to be able to do basic math – like multiplication, division, addition and subtraction – quickly and without error. Moreover, because bureaucracy works best when the individuals filling its ranks are identical and interchangeable, a system that churned out these bureaucratic cogs en masse was required. In response, the ancestor to today's education system was born.

Today, the need to staff a global British empire is long-gone, and yet the schools remain. According to Mitra, “Schools as we know them are obsolete.” If that is so, then what is the future of education, and how do we get there?

To answer this, Mitra changes narrative direction. He explains how he was teaching programing in New Delhi next door to a slum when an idea evolved. Some of his wealthy acquaintances consistently claimed that their children were very gifted, citing as evidence all of the remarkable things they could do with computers. Why, Mitra wondered, were these children so talented? Was it simply because they came from wealthy families? Surely not. Driven by curiosity, Mitra came up with an experiment. He put an old laptop in a hole in a wall in the slum next door to his office and asked the children to play with it. Then he left, wondering what the children could teach themselves. He came back later, and these kids who had known nothing of computers – they were poor Indian children – asked him for “a faster processor and a better mouse.”

They had taught themselves. Mitra repeated this experiment again and again in multiple locations across India. He recorded the rate that the children acquired proficiency, and that lead him to this conclusion – after leaving children alone with a computer for nine months, they would reach the same level of proficiency as an average office worker. Amazing as it was, it happened again and again.

Mitra went on to show that children could teach themselves more than just computational technology. For example, he provided a speech-to-text converter to help poor, rural Indian children improve their English pronunciation. And, his hole-in-the-wall computer technology helped similarly poor and rural children from Southern India learn the biotechnology of DNA replication, all from resources written in English, a foreign language.

His experiments were conducted over decades, and they all lead Mitra to wonder, “Do we really need schools at all?” This is a radical question to ask, because doing away with schools means doing away with adult role models and the nurturing safety they can provide to encourage learning. However, rather than entirely eliminating supervision, Mitra concedes that, at least to a small degree, children need the guidance and motivation that an experienced and compassionate adult can deliver. However, this is where the similarities with traditional education stop.

Rather than our conventional notion of a brick and mortar school, he envisions something called, “The School in the Cloud.” There, small groups of children are paired online with a single adult facilitator who asks “big” questions about a topic of interest - much like Mitra provided big open-ended challenges to the children interacting with his hole-in-the-wall computers. In addition to providing the initial impetus, the adult facilitators offer encouragement when appropriate. Once a question is posed, the children take over. Working collaboratively, they are completely self-directed and construct knowledge to answer the questions posed. They educate themselves.

How sensible are Mitra’s ideas? Will they work? Is he asking too much of technology and too much of students? Do his ideas align with our current environment of standards-based testing? Do they result in the reading, writing, math and critical thinking skills students need to be successful in the job's of tomorrow?

While his approach engenders a laundry list of questions, his ideas are consistent with the way humans have been constructing knowledge and learning since the Enlightenment. We focus on a topic. We ask questions and propose solutions, and we determine whether these are consistent with experiment and observation. We refine our initial ideas as we go – this is the essence of the scientific method. It is a time-tested approach that enabled the innovation that catapulted us through the industrial revolution and into the midst of an economy driven by technology and information. An economy without which, Mitra's ideas would be impossible to realize or even conceive of. So, there is precedence, and Mitra has a number of anecdotal success stories that make his ideas compelling.

Other’s have also found his idea’s compelling. In 2013, <a class="blog-link" href="https://www.ted.com/participate/ted-prize/prize-winning-wishes/school-in-the-cloud">Mitra was awarded the first-ever $1 million dollar TED prize</a> to transform his ideas to brick and mortar – or network cables and computers, at least. It will be interesting to see how his ideas translate at scale and whether they really produce learning outcomes that outpace those returned by today’s traditional education.
